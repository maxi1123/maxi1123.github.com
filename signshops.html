It is supposed to be a central place for players to buy items they need or sell unnecessary junk. A Player is allowed to open a shop wherever he wants (Tutorial below) but has to read the rules applying to the Sign Shops <a href="http://earthcraftsurvival.com/rules.html">here</a></p><p>There are <strong>two</strong> different types of Sign Shops: Admin Shops and Player created shops.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You'll only find Admin Shops in the spawn area</li>
  <li>Player created shops are using a chest where the items to sell are stored. The specific shop has as many items to buy as the player has left in the chest. When there aren't any items in the chest anymore, it will show you the message "out of stock". Contact the shop's owner if you think he should fill the chest again or go to the Admin Shop.</li>
</ul><p>There are <strong>two</strong> different ways to buy and sell items. - When it is an Admin Shop: Just rightclick the [Buy] or [Sell] sign. - When it is a player shop: Rightclick the sign to buy an item or leftclick the sign to sell an item.</p><p>When you first join the server your account will be credited with 2500$, you can make money in three ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sell items to a shop</li>
  <li>Open a shop and have other players buy your items</li>
  <li><a href="http://earthcraftsurvival.com/vote.html">Vote</a> for the server and receive 3500$ for every vote</li>
</ul><p>Before opening a shop, be sure to read the Sign Shops rules <a href="http://earthcraftsurvival.com/rules.html">here</a></p><h1>How to set up shops</h1><p>You will need a chest, a sign and at least one item.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Place the chest.</li>
  <li>Put in one (or more) item(s) of the kind you want to sell/buy. Remember, you can only sell as many items as you have put into the chest. When they are all bought, you have to fill the chest again. Otherwise the shop is "out of stock".</li>
  <li>Place a sign above the chest.</li>
  <li>On the first line write your name.</li>
  <li>On the second line write the amount of items you want to sell at once.</li>
  <li>On the third line write these parameters: B [YourBuyPrice]:[YourSellPrice] S</li>
  <li>On the last line write the Item's name or the ID.</li>
