#FAQ

###What ranks are there? What commands can I use?
See [this page](http://earthcraftsurvival.com/ranks.html)

###Why can't I build/use commands?
You are probably in the [Griefer] or [Guest] group. See below how to become Member.

###How can I become VIP?
[Donate](http://earthcraftsurvival.com/donate.html)

###How can I become Moderator or Admin?
You don't need to ask for any of these ranks, if the server is looking for staff an admin will contact you. Increase your chances of being chosen by frequently playing on the server and following the rules.

###Why am I banned?
Most likely you broke the [rules] (http://earthcraftsurvival.com/rules). Please contact admin[at]earthcraftsurvival[dot]com if you think it is in error.

###What happens after a minecraft update was released?
Since it usually takes [Bukkit] (http://bukkit.org/) a few days to be updated (and for all its plugins to work properly) you can meanwhile play on a temporary map. We use a temporary map to prevent the actual worlds from being griefed without having to shut down the entire server.
